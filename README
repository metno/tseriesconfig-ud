Tseries config files for export

to build the config files manually (for development purposes)

run

./autogen.sh
./configure --prefix=[your target directory]
make install


after that - run tseries.bin -s [your target directory]/tseries/[version number]/tseries.ctl



To install the config files properly:

run

debuild -us -uc -b

it will generate a debian package in ../

install it with dpkg -i [debian_package]


You have to adapt your version number to the version number of tseries
change the package number in configure.ac (AC_INIT) to fit the tseries version
remember to adapt the changelog as well (with the proper version number)
